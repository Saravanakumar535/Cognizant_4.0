# Singleton Pattern Example in C#

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Singleton Design Pattern** in C# using a simple `Logger` class.

## ðŸ“Œ What is the Singleton Pattern?

The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the lifetime of an application and provides a global point of access to it.

### ðŸ›  Key Features

- Only one instance of `Logger` is ever created.
- Multiple calls to `Logger.GetInstance()` return the same instance.
- Ensures controlled access and lazy initialization.
